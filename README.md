Explore React
====

Greetings adventurer! On our last trip we explored a [popular nodejs library](http://x-team.com/2015/02/xplorers-mkdirp/) and discovered some interesting gems there. That was ~100 lines of code, and this time we're going to attempt something a little more ambitious: [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/)!

It can be a daunting experience to be using your favourite framework and then suddenly find yourself knee-deep in stack traces with little idea of how to navigate your way out. After today's journey you'll be one step closer to mastering this weird and wonderful terrain.
